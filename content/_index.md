May is likely to be possible to do this on Windows, I haven't played in this space

### Approaches to Amnesia

All previous examples were generally amnesic by utilising RAM to store data

### Alternate Approaches to RAM Exist

- ZFS snapshots
- BTRFS subvolumes

Why Use Them?

### Amnesiac As A Trait

Far more than just hiding questionable things

## How to Build and Manage Amnesiac Systems

---

Let's talk on two deployment types:

- not our machine (business purpose)
- our machine (application of good hygiene)

---

### Not Our Machine

Cattle vs Pets

---

Or, most people enjoy a good hamburger

---

Generally, docker, serverless et al is a safe bet here

State can exist externally

---

Unless you need to host the whole stack...

(Pets at some level)

Questions?

Thanks!
